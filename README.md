# Etch-a-Sketch

In this project, you’ll be <strong>creating a pretty neat toy</strong> to flex your <strong>DOM manipulation skills</strong>. You’re going to build a browser version of something between a <em>sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch</em>.

This project should <em>not</em> be easy for you.<BR>
You’ll probably have to <strong>Google frequently</strong> to get the right JavaScript methods and CSS to use – in fact, <em>that’s the point!</em>

You can build this using the tools that you have already learned, and there are plenty of resources on the net for learning stuff that we haven’t covered yet if you decide you need it.<br>

We’ll walk you through the basic steps, but it will be up to you to actually implement them.
